/// When a spawned process actually died, timed from a thread of its own.
///
/// **Why not time the `await`.** A runner's deadline is enforced on a global
/// queue, but the caller only learns of it when its task resumes, and that
/// needs a free cooperative thread. Swift Testing runs synchronous tests on
/// that pool too, so on a three-core CI runner a few long ones held it for
/// ~19 seconds and every test that started meanwhile — pure parsing ones
/// included — reported 18–19 seconds. A child killed at three seconds was
/// measured at twenty-two and failed `< 20` (the 1.12.1 build, 2026-10-16).
/// Saturating the pool locally reproduces it: the child dies on time, the
/// caller resumes when the pool frees.
///
/// So the claim "killed at the deadline" is timed here, by polling `kill(pid,
/// 0)` on a dedicated thread that no test can starve. The script writes its
/// own pid to `pidFile`; anything still alive at `giveUpAfter` is killed so a
/// failing test does not leak it.
///
/// **The clock it is compared with has to start just as late.** This instant
/// is not, by itself, how long the program was given. A clock started before
/// `run` or `fetch` still includes the wait for a utility-QoS thread, and
/// that wait is not the time limit — the 1.4.28 Build measured 12.9 seconds
/// that way, with the program already dead and the call back under a second
/// later. `OwnThreadTiming` starts its clock on the thread that runs the
/// synchronous runner, and the tests subtract that.
