/// Keeping Pulse up to date, through Sparkle.
///
/// **An EdDSA key is what makes this safe without an Apple Developer ID.**
/// Sparkle refuses any archive not signed by the key in `Info.plist`, whoever
/// served it — so the update path is verifiable even though the app itself
/// carries only an ad-hoc signature. Apple's signing and notarisation are
/// recommended by Sparkle rather than required, and the one thing they would
/// fix — Gatekeeper blocking the *first* launch — is not something an updater
/// can help with anyway.
///
/// **Nothing starts unless Pulse is running from a bundle.** Sparkle needs an
/// `Info.plist` carrying the feed URL and that public key, its framework in
/// `Contents/Frameworks`, and a version to compare against; a `swift run`
/// build has none of them. Started anyway it would log complaints about a
/// missing feed forever, and telling a developer their working copy is out of
/// date is noise.
///
/// Sparkle owns the schedule and the windows it puts up. What is kept here is
/// only what the rest of the app asks about: whether a check can happen at
/// all, whether one is running, and whether a newer version was found — which
/// is what the menu bar shows. A scheduled find follows `UpdateDiscovery`:
/// notify first posts a notification and leaves the window hidden until that
/// notification is clicked; show the window is Sparkle's offer immediately;
/// install silently downloads and installs the next time Blinky quits, with
/// no notification and no window. The decision is `UpdateAnnouncement`, which
/// does not touch Sparkle. The one extra step when the offer window does show
/// is activation: this process is an `.accessory` app, and Sparkle's own
/// driver shows a found update behind every other app unless something has
/// made this one `.regular` first.
///
/// **The installed file name is not changed from this delegate.** Sparkle
/// writes the update over `host.bundlePath` because
/// `SPARKLE_NORMALIZE_INSTALLED_APPLICATION_NAME` is off in the SwiftPM
/// framework, then relaunches that path. `updaterWillRelaunchApplication`
/// runs in the process that is quitting, before the helper installs, so it
/// cannot point the relaunch at `Blinky.app`. `InstalledAppName` renames
/// `Pulse.app` on the launch that follows.
