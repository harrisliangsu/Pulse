/// cannot be found again. The icon is there while **any** tracked window (the
/// main window, a recap, the service chooser) is on screen and
/// `AppSettings.showsDockIconInSettings` allows it, and Pulse is a menu bar
/// app again the moment neither is true.
///
/// `AppSettings.alwaysShowsDockIcon` overrides that. While it is on, the
/// policy is `.regular` whether or not a window is open. It is applied at
/// the start of launch as well, so the icon is there before a window opens.
/// `LSUIElement` stays true: with the switch off, the Dock is not told about
/// Blinky at all until a window asks.
///
/// Sparkle's update window is not one of those tracked windows. An accessory
/// policy is also why that window opens behind everything else, so while the
/// offer is up the icon stays even if the window switch is off.
///
/// One owner rather than one per window: with each controller setting the
/// policy itself, closing the main window under an open recap — or the
/// other way round — took the Dock icon away from the window still showing.
///
/// `.regular` is also what puts Pulse in ⌘-Tab, which is the point.
