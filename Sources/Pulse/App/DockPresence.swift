/// the start of launch as well, so the icon is there before a window opens.

/// Blinky at all until a window asks.
///
/// Sparkle's update window is not one of those tracked windows. An accessory
/// policy is also why that window opens behind everything else, so while the
/// offer is up the icon stays even if the window switch is off.
///
/// One owner rather than one per window: with each controller setting the
