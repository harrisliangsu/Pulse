/// What the servers said during one account's check, for Settings'
/// connection diagnostics: each request's address, status, type and body.
///
/// **Why.** A reading turns a reply into one of a few reasons, and a reason is
/// a guess about what the reply meant: OpenCode Go's "subscription required"
/// was a 403, and every 403 read as a refused key, so a lapsed plan sent
/// someone to replace a key that worked. The reply itself settles it.
///
/// **What is kept, and what never is.** The method, the address without its
/// query (a key can travel in one), the status, the content type and the
/// first `bodyLimit` characters of the body — **never a request header**, so
/// no key, token or cookie Pulse sends; and in the body, every value under a
/// name that sounds like a credential, and every long unbroken run of the
/// characters tokens are made of, replaced by `mask` (`redacted`). A reply can
/// still name the account — an email, a plan, a balance — which is why it is
/// shown to the person and kept out of the shareable report
/// (`ConnectionDiagnostic.report`).
///
/// **Memory only, the last check only.** One check's replies ride on the
/// raw reading into `ConnectionDiagnostic` and are replaced by the next;
/// nothing is written to disk.
///
/// Requests are recorded by `URLSession.recordedData(for:)`, which the
/// providers use for every request they make while their check runs
/// (`capture`), and the status pages while their pane reads them
/// (`capturing`, to say why a read failed). A request made outside either —
/// a sign-in, the background outage check — records nothing.
