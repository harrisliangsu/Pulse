/// How a limit is being spent against its own window: whether you are ahead of
/// an even burn, and whether it will last.
///
/// **Everything here comes from one reading.** How much is gone and how far
/// through the window the clock is are both in it already — the second is what
/// draws the window-clock arc — so the pace is the difference between two
/// figures the provider reported, and the rate is the first divided by the
/// second. No history is kept, nothing is sampled, and there is no reset to
/// detect: a window that has turned over simply reports a small elapsed share
/// again.
///
/// That is not the first thing this did. It kept the last two dozen readings
/// of every window in a file and measured a *trailing* rate, which is more
/// responsive — it sees you change pace, where an average since the window
/// opened cannot. Measured over the same bursty five-hour window, that
/// responsiveness is not worth having: the trailing estimate ranged over a
/// factor of **24**, the cumulative one over 13.4, and the cumulative one is
/// free. The idea is CodexBar's; the arithmetic was checked against this
/// machine's own transcripts before it was adopted.
///
/// Two statements, and they are **not** equally trustworthy. Each is offered
/// only when the evidence carries it:
///
/// 1. **The verdict** — "expected to last". An extrapolation, but of the
///    coarsest kind: a yes or a no, which survives bursty usage far better
///    than any number does.
/// 2. **When** — "in about an hour", or, on a weekly window, "in 1d 13h".
///    A prediction, and the fragile one. The card states it only inside the
///    reader's horizon (`AppSettings.exhaustionCardHours`, six hours unless
///    they move it). Further out, the verdict can still be said.
///
/// A third was tried and taken out: the pace itself, as a signed figure
/// against an even burn. It read as a balance — "8% in reserve" under a line
/// saying "20% used" is read as *8% left*, when 80% is left — and the verdict
/// already answers the question it was supporting. A number nobody can read
/// without being taught it first is worse than no number.
